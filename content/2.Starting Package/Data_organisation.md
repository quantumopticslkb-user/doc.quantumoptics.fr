## Introduction
The team has access to a server, LEON, allowing us to store all our data as well as any file. This is probably the most important tool of the team.  
First you need to follow the tutorial to have acces to the LKB network: <NuxtLink to="/Starting Package/Tools"> Usefool tools </NuxtLink>.  
It is very important to master it in order to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and to work efficiently.  
The real challenge is: how to organise our data?

## Data
Here is an example of how the repository should looks:
  ```bash
  EQ15B\LEON-15B\DATA\your_team\year\the_project\topic\date
  ```

  </code-block>

This is an example of how to do your organisation but of course you also have to pay attention to the tree structure to store your presentations (slides) or figures that others might have to use, posters (svg files), etc...  
For your data that you want to keep only for yourself it is possible to use your own available users file (ex: mabobaker).
