- D1 to D2 switch ?
- Scan / Lock etc ...

### MuQuans : Kapaz

- How to control it
- AFG
- Scan
- SAS / FP : frequency measurement

## Cameras

Cameras to see both real space and Fourier space.

### Real space : PointGrey Grasshopper

Nice and easy cam. Python setup ?

### Fourier space : Hamamatsu ORCA

Complicated and fancy cam. Python setup ?
